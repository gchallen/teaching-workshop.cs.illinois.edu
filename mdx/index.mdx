**We are excited to invite you to the inaugural Illinois Computer Science Summer Teaching Workshop.**
Our goal is to bring together college instructors who are engaged with teaching computer science to discuss best practices, present new ideas, challenge the status quo, propose new directions, debunk existing assumptions, advocate for new approaches, and present surprising or preliminary results.
Teaching faculty, research faculty, as well as graduate and undergraduate students are all invited to participate.

**The 2021 workshop will be held virtually over two half-days on August 10â€“11, 2021.**
This year's theme is _How the Pandemic Transformed Our Teaching_, allowing participants to reflect on the difficult year behind us as we prepare to return to classrooms next fall.

## Abstract Submission

Presentation submission and registration are now open.

<a href="https://www.seltzer.com/margo/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Margo I. Seltzer</a> is Canada 150 Research Chair in Computer Systems and the Cheriton Family chair in Computer Science at the University
of British Columbia. Her research interests are in systems, construed quite broadly: systems for capturing and accessing
data provenance, file systems, databases, transaction processing systems, storage and analysis of graph-structured data,
new architectures for parallelizing execution, and systems that apply technology to problems in healthcare.

In addition to many other awards, Professor Seltzer is recognized as an outstanding teacher and mentor, having received the Phi Beta Kappa teaching award in 1996, the Abrahmson Teaching Award in 1999, the Capers and Marion McDonald Award for Excellence in Mentoring and Advising in 2010, and the CRA-E Undergraduate Research Mentoring Award in 2017.
