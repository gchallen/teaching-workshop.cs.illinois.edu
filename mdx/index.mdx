## Workshop Announcement

The 2022 Illinois Computer science Summer Teaching Workshop will be held virtually over two half-days on August 15â€“16, 2022.
Our goal is to bring together college instructors who are engaged with teaching computer science to discuss best practices, present new ideas, challenge the status quo, propose new directions, debunk existing assumptions, advocate for new approaches, and present surprising or preliminary results.
The 2022 theme is **Feedback, Online Assessment, and Building an Inclusive Classroom**, allowing participants to share how they provide feedback to their students, delve into the pros and cons of certain online assessment methods, or reflect on steps taken to create an inclusive classroom.
