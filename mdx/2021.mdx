## Workshop Announcement

The 2021 workshop was held virtually over two half-days on August 10–11, 2021.
It brought together college instructors who are engaged with teaching computer science to discuss best practices, present new ideas, challenge the status quo, propose new directions, debunk existing assumptions, advocate for new approaches, and present surprising or preliminary results.
The 2021 theme was _How the Pandemic Transformed Our Teaching_, allowing participants to reflect on the difficult year behind us as we prepared to return to classrooms in Fall 2021.

## Schedule and Program

The workshop was held on Tuesday and Wednesday August 10–11, 2021.
