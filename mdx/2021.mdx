**We are excited to invite you to the inaugural Illinois Computer Science Summer Teaching Workshop.**
The 2021 workshop will be held virtually over two half-days on August 10–11, 2021.
The workshop is free to attend, and teaching faculty, research faculty, as well as graduate and undergraduate students are all invited to participate—either by
<a href="https://forms.gle/f34hV4kE6Nnkw4Ca7" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">presenting</a>,
or by
<a href="https://forms.gle/f34hV4kE6Nnkw4Ca7" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">joining in the conversation</a>.

Our goal is to bring together college instructors who are engaged with teaching computer science to discuss best practices, present new ideas, challenge the status quo, propose new directions, debunk existing assumptions, advocate for new approaches, and present surprising or preliminary results.
This year's theme is _How the Pandemic Transformed Our Teaching_, allowing participants to reflect on the difficult year behind us as we prepare to return to classrooms next fall.

## Schedule and Program

The workshop will be held on Tuesday and Wednesday August 10–11, 2021.
Each day will have two sessions: one from 10AM–12PM, and a second from 1–3PM, all times Central.
In between the two sessions there will be a (virtual) opportunity for participants to meet and get to know each other.

The program will be posted later in the summer.

## Abstract Submission and Registration

Presentation submission and registration are now open.
Please use <a href="https://forms.gle/f34hV4kE6Nnkw4Ca7" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">this form</a> to either register or submit your abstract.
Each talk slot will be 30-minutes in length.
However, talks should be 20-minutes or shorter, to leave ample time for discussion.
Abstract submissions will be accepted on a rolling basis.

If you want to attend without presenting, simply do not enter an abstract.
We look forward to seeing you in early August!
